## About Me  
I am a cybersecurity graduate with hands-on experience in security operations, digital forensics, and incident response within academic and simulated enterprise environments. I am motivated by protecting organizations and people through practical threat detection, log analysis, and NIST-aligned incident response, and I am committed to continuously developing my skills to help organizations reduce risk and improve their security posture.
