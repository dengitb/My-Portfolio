## Risk Assessment

### Risk Description

Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards.

### Control Best Practices

The first of the five functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) is **Identify**. Botium Toys must dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them. Assets should be classified, and the potential impact of asset loss (including systems) on business continuity should be assessed.

### Risk Score

On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is **8**, indicating a high level of risk. This elevated risk is due to a lack of security controls and insufficient adherence to compliance best practices.

## Additional Comments

The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as **medium**, because the IT department does not have full visibility into which assets would be affected. The overall risk to assets and potential regulatory fines is considered **high** because required controls and compliance best practices are not fully implemented to protect sensitive data.

**Key observations:**

- All employees currently have access to internally stored data and may be able to access cardholder data and customers’ PII/SPII

- Access controls related to least privilege and separation of duties have not been implemented  
- Availability controls and data integrity mechanisms exist  
- A firewall is deployed with defined security rules  
- Antivirus software is installed and monitored regularly  
- No intrusion detection system (IDS) is in place  
- No disaster recovery plans exist, and there are no backups of critical data  
- A breach notification plan exists for EU customers within 72 hours; privacy policies and procedures are documented and enforced  
- Password policy exists but does not meet minimum complexity requirements  
- No centralized password management system is in place  
- Legacy systems are monitored without a formal schedule or defined intervention procedures  
- Physical security controls are in place, including locks, CCTV surveillance, and fire detection/prevention systems
