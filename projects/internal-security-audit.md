# Internal Security Audit & Compliance Assessment (Simulated Enterprise)

## Project Overview  
This case study documents an internal security audit conducted within a simulated enterprise environment to evaluate organizational security posture and compliance readiness. The objective was to review the audit scope and risk assessment, assess existing controls across administrative, technical, and physical domains, and identify compliance gaps related to payment card data and customer privacy. The final deliverable was a completed controls and compliance checklist with prioritized recommendations to reduce risk and improve business continuity.

---

## Organizational Context  
**Environment Type:** Simulated small business with a physical office, storefront, warehouse, and an expanding e-commerce presence serving domestic and international customers.  
**Business Challenge:** Rapid online growth increased pressure on IT operations to securely support e-commerce transactions while protecting customer data and maintaining operational continuity.  
**Audit Drivers:** Elevated risk of data exposure, service disruption, and regulatory or financial impact due to missing security controls and incomplete compliance practices.

## Audit Scope and Objectives  
The audit scope and initial risk posture were defined using the organization’s scope, goals, and risk assessment documentation:

- <a href="./artifacts/botium-toys-scope-goals-risk-assessment.md">Botium Toys: Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report</a>

**Scope:**  
- Employee devices and endpoints  
- Internal network and internet connectivity  
- Core business systems (e-commerce, databases, inventory, accounting)  
- Data storage and retention practices  
- Legacy systems requiring manual monitoring  
- Physical facilities (office, storefront, warehouse)  

**Objectives:**  
- Identify and categorize critical assets and exposure areas  
- Evaluate the presence and effectiveness of administrative, technical, and physical controls  
- Assess compliance readiness for payment security and data privacy obligations  
- Produce actionable, risk-prioritized recommendations to strengthen security posture  

---

## Control Framework & Methodology  
Control effectiveness was evaluated using standardized control categories to ensure consistent assessment across people, process, and technology domains:

- <a href="./artifacts/control-categories.md">Control Categories (Administrative, Technical, Physical Controls)</a>

This framework was used to map existing safeguards, identify control gaps, and evaluate coverage across preventative, detective, corrective, and deterrent controls.

---

## Key Assets Reviewed  
- End-user devices and peripherals (desktops/laptops, smartphones, remote workstations)  
- Internal network infrastructure and internet access  
- Business applications and data stores (e-commerce platform, databases, inventory systems)  
- Sensitive customer data (payment information, PII)  
- Legacy systems requiring ongoing maintenance  
- Physical security controls protecting facilities and equipment  

---

## Risk Snapshot  
- **Overall Risk Level:** High  
- **Primary Risk Factors:**  
  - Limited asset visibility and classification  
  - Broad internal access to sensitive data (payment data and PII)  
  - Lack of encryption for sensitive information  
  - Absence of least privilege and separation of duties  
  - Limited detection visibility due to missing IDS  
  - No formal backups or disaster recovery planning  
  - Weak password policy enforcement and no centralized password management  

- **Existing Baseline Controls:**  
  - Firewall filtering  
  - Antivirus protection  
  - Physical security measures (locks, CCTV, fire detection/prevention)  
  - Breach notification procedures aligned with privacy obligations

## Controls Assessment Summary  

### Administrative / Managerial Controls  
Control effectiveness was evaluated using standard control categories to assess policy enforcement, access control practices, and recovery preparedness. Gaps were identified in least privilege enforcement, separation of duties, password policy strength, centralized password management, and disaster recovery planning.

### Technical Controls  
Technical safeguards were reviewed using established control classifications to identify gaps in detection, encryption, and recovery capabilities. Baseline protections (firewall, antivirus) were present, but critical gaps were observed in intrusion detection, data encryption, and backup mechanisms.

### Physical / Operational Controls  
Physical protections were assessed against operational control categories to validate facility-level security posture. Existing controls such as locks, CCTV, and fire detection/prevention provided a baseline level of protection for facilities and physical assets.

## Compliance Assessment & Audit Deliverables  
Compliance readiness and control implementation were documented using a structured assessment checklist:

- <a href="./artifacts/controls-and-compliance-checklist.md">Controls and Compliance Checklist (Completed Audit Deliverable)</a>

**Assessment Focus Areas:**  
- Payment data protection and access control practices  
- Data privacy and breach notification readiness  
- Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data  

---

## Recommendations (Prioritized)  
- Enforce least privilege and role-based access control for sensitive systems  
- Implement encryption for payment data and sensitive customer information  
- Establish regular backups and formal disaster recovery procedures  
- Deploy intrusion detection to improve threat visibility  
- Strengthen password policies and implement centralized password management  
- Formalize asset inventory, classification, and ownership processes  

---

## Outcomes and Skills Demonstrated  
**Outcomes:**  
- Identified critical security and compliance gaps affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability  
- Produced a prioritized remediation plan to strengthen security posture and resilience  

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Internal security auditing and control evaluation  
- Risk analysis and prioritization  
- Compliance gap assessment (payment security and data privacy)  
- Security documentation and stakeholder-focused recommendations  

---

## Lessons Learned  
- Asset visibility and access control are foundational to reducing organizational risk.  
- Detection and recovery capabilities are essential to minimizing operational impact during incidents.  
- Translating audit findings into prioritized, actionable recommendations is critical for improving real-world security posture.
